# Fraud-Detection-Machine-Learning-
Fraud detection involves identifying and preventing deceptive activities within financial transactions or systems. Leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, fraud detection systems aim to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent behavior.




Key Concepts and Challenges:

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior within
data.
Machine Learning Models: Employing algorithm that is Random Forest for predictive analysis.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to enhance fraud
detection accuracy.
Real-time Monitoring: Implementing systems that can detect and respond to fraudulent
activities in real-time.
Scalability: Designing fraud detection systems capable of handling large volumes of
transactions efficiently.
